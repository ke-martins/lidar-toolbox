function [ grid_data ] = fun_multibeam_lidar_gridding( time , x_grid , y_grid , raw_data , t_win , x_win , y_win )
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Function gridding (both time and space) the raw data from multibeam lidar systems.
% This was initially written for processing the data collected at Duck with UAV-mounted lidar systems.
% It assumes minimal pre-processing for the input data, with the idea to make this function as generic as possible. 
% At minima, it needs a time (array of size nb_data x 1) and xyz (array of size nb_data x 3) to work properly.
%
% Inputs:
%   time         - time interpolation grid
%   x_grid       - x interpolation grid
%   y_grid       - y interpolation grid
%   raw_data     - data structure containing de-noised raw data; minimum data fields: time (Np x 1); xyz (Np x 3)
%   t_win        - time window [s] within which data is used for the time interpolation 
%                  e.g., if t_win = 0.15 s, then for each time ti of the grid, the algorithm will use data within 0.15 s 
%                  both in past (ti-0.15) and future (ti+0.15). I suggest +- 1.5/original fs (i.e., 3 full scans are used)
%   x_win, y_win - cross-shore and longshore space window parameters [m] within which data needs to be present for keeping interpolated value (NaN is used otherwise), see below
%
% Outputs:
%   grid_data - a self-explanatory data structure containing the gridded lidar data
%
% Comments on parameters t_win and x_win:
%   In some way, t_win and x_win are used to select the interpolation data points and indirectly define regions outside of which, 
%   data is not interpolated. So increasing those two parameters will fill in more gaps, but potentially increase the number of irrealistic points.
%   This is slightly less true for t_win, but keep in mind that increasing t_win also slows down the interpolation process 
%   since more data is being used to create the interpolant.
