# lidar-toolbox: a MATLAB set of libraries to handle nearshore wave data collected with lidars üåä

This is part of **lidar-toolbox**: a MATLAB set of libraries to handle nearshore wave data collected with lidars. This sub-directory contains several examples to handle lidar data, including a complete workflow example for the implementation of the non-linear depth inversion algorithm of Martins et al. (2023) on field lidar data. It relies on most libraries within **lidar-toolbox** to grid the raw multibeam lidar data (**lidar-gridding**), and perform spectral, cross-spectral and bispectral analyses of gappy free surface elevation timeseries (**gappy-series-preprocessing** and **spectral-analysis**). This example accompanies the manuscript describing this lidar implementation of *lidBathy* and submitted to *CENG* (Martins et al., submitted). A list of other relevant publications that used this toolbox is given at the bottom of this page.  

### Prerequisite: pre-processed lidar data file for SIO flight #2 of BELS2022 experiments  
Please make sure you download the pre-processed lidar data file before running example. It is pretty heavy, and hosted elsewhere as github do not easily accommodate for files this big. Two options are proposed below:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub><sup>1Ô∏è‚É£</sup></sub> Manually download the file at the following link; and place it into `data/` directory: [20220912_191123_flight_2_x=225.mat](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13Qk01nyErT1LT-RtmG7dNQtoTl9gqpHI) üìÑ  
&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub><sup>2Ô∏è‚É£</sup></sub> Directly through the MATLAB code provided and the `gdown` command  
Please use option 1 is you do not wish to install the `gdown` command, though it is a super light utility. The MATLAB code (multibeam_lidar_gridding.m or lidBathy_workflow_example.m) will install the `gdown` utility if needed, and download the file through the following commands (Unix systems only for now):    
```bash
pip install gdown
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13Qk01nyErT1LT-RtmG7dNQtoTl9gqpHI
mv 20220912_191123_flight_2_x=225.mat data/
```
