# lidar-toolbox: a MATLAB set of libraries to handle nearshore wave data collected with lidars üåä

Welcome to this short documentation of **lidar-toolbox**: a MATLAB set of libraries to handle nearshore wave data collected with lidar scanners. In essence, the **spectral-analysis** library is an adaptation of my **bispectral-analysis** library to lidar data (https://github.com/ke-martins/bispectral-analysis). This adaptation was motivated while working on the lidBathy tool, a nonlinear, lidar-based, nearshore depth inversion algorithm (Martins et al., submitted). A list of other relevant publications that used this toolbox is given at the bottom of this page. Although this toolbox was intended for surface elevation datasets, it can be used for other signals bearing in mind the provided units would be wrong. At the moment, there are 4 inter-dependent sub-libraries, each dedicated to specific functions described below, but this is expected to grow in the future, and include libraries for data acquisition for instance.

  **Description**:  
  Library containing functions that grid (spatial and temporal interpolations) data collected by single- or multibeam lidar scanners. It is based on the function built function `scatteredInterpolant` (Delaunay triangulation) and makes the most of 4D (t,x,y,z) point clouds to interpolate raw data on grids and respect some quality criteria.

  **List of functions**:  

  fun_gridded_lidar_diagnostics.m  
  fun_singlebeam_lidar_gridding.m  
  fun_multibeam_lidar_gridding.m
