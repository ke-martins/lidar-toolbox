function [ time_mat , signal_mat ] = fun_prep_gappy_series_by_block( time , signal , nfft , overlap , thperNaN )
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Function restructuring a potentially gappy series into a matrix with overlapping blocks of length nfft.
% This is intended to prepare the timeseries for spectral analysis, using a threshold on the percentage of NaNs allowed per block,
% for quality control. This is particularly useful for lidar data, for instance, which can be quite gappy, 
% or to deal with large blocs of NaNs within a data series. We also keep track of time, if needed.
%
% Inputs:
%   time       - time (unit not important, we send back what is input); size : length(time) x 1
%   signal     - series of (potentially gappy) data; size : length(time) x 1
%   nfft       - bloc length for the FFT [default = 256]
%   overlap    - percentage overlap (typical is 50%, 75% optimises edof)
%   thperNaN   - maximal percentage of NaNs allowed within block of data
%
% Outputs: 
%   time_mat   - time matrix corresponding to block of data
%   signal_mat - data matrix of size ( nfft , number of blocks with less than thperNaN % of NaNs)
