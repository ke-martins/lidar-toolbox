function [ time_mat , signal_1_mat , signal_2_mat ] = fun_prep_gappy_series_by_block_xs( time , signal_1 , signal_2 , nfft , overlap , thperNaN ) 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Function restructuring two potentially gappy series into matrices with overlapping blocks of length nfft.
% This is intended to prepare the timeseries for cross-spectral analysis, using a threshold on the percentage of NaNs allowed per block,
% for quality control. This is particularly useful for lidar data, for instance, which can be quite gappy, 
% or to deal with large blocs of NaNs within a data series. We also keep track of time, if needed.
%
% Inputs:
%   time         - time (unit not important, we send back what is input); size : length(time) x 1
%   signal_1     - series 1 of (potentially gappy) data; size : length(time) x 1
%   signal_2     - series 2 of (potentially gappy) data; size : length(time) x 1
%   nfft         - bloc length for the FFT [default = 256]
%   overlap      - percentage overlap (typical is 50%, 75% optimises edof)
%   thperNaN     - maximal percentage of NaNs allowed within block of data
%
% Outputs: 
%   time_mat     - time matrix corresponding to block of data
%   signal_1_mat - data matrix from signal_1 of size ( nfft , number of blocks where both signal_1 and signal_2 have less than thperNaN % of NaNs)
%   signal_2_mat - data matrix from signal_2 of size ( nfft , number of blocks where both signal_1 and signal_2 have less than thperNaN % of NaNs)
